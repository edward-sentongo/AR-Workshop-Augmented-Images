# AR-Workshop:  Part 4 Augmented Images.
In this sample app, we'll use the power of ARCore to recognized images and we'll add information on to those images.<br/> 
- minimum 300x300
- the less repeated patterns the better
- More info [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/augmented-images/)
- Let's get creative!

***How to***
1. Download the code and compile it.  

2. Scan (with the camera of your phone) any image from [here](https://github.com/edward-sentongo/AR-Workshop-Augumented-Images/tree/master/ImagesToPrintOrScan), please don't scan Jedi yet :).  
Prefferably scan images which have <strong>"final"<strong/>.   

3. Do you see the augumented image?  

4. Modify the code with your own objects.

5. Get creative now
